## Review

>*It’s a rainy, foggy morning and you’ve just arrived to Codecool. There’s something strange there…
>You don’t see anybody in the office, it’s silent and forsaken. There are not even notebooks on the tables. It’s 9:00. You’re >checking your calendar if it’s a weekday or not. It is… It’s Wednesday.
>What happened???
>Suddenly you hear something from the kitchen. A little noise, something like a voice of a squeaking  mouse. Then some thumps…
>What do you do?*
