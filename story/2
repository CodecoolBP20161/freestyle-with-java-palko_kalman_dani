In the kitchen there are horrible things. There’s a bloody hand hangin’ out the dishwasher and there’s a sign on the wall, written in blood: “GO TO MISKOLC!!!WE NEED BODA JÓZSI!ONLY HE CAN SAVE US!!!”
And those pretty little noises again… maybe they come from inside the dishwasher…
You are totally shocked.
What’s the next step?
A: Run away screaming, hop on the train.
B: Go to the dishwasher. You don’t like things being mysterious…
