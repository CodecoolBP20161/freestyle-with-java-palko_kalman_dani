It’s a rainy, foggy morning and you’ve just arrived to Codecool. There’s something strange there…
You don’t see anybody in the office, it’s silent and forsaken. There are not even notebooks on the tables.
It’s 9:00.
You’re checking your calendar if it’s a weekday or not. It is… It’s Wednesday.
What happened???
Suddenly you hear something from the kitchen. A little noise, something like a voice of a squeaking  mouse. Then some thumps…
What do you do?
A: Getting scared, turn back and run away!
B: Let’s go to the kitchen!
